# Parser

The Translator is a multimodal deep learning model, which consists of an image encoder, a sentence
encoder, a fusion module and a sentence decoder that takes a complex natural language instruction and outputs simple executable atomic sentences for a UR-5 Robot.

The Executor takes the simpler atomic natural language robotic instructions and executes the task in a simulated environment for a UR-5 Robot. The tasks involve identifying objects, picking and placing objects and pushing and rotating objects.
